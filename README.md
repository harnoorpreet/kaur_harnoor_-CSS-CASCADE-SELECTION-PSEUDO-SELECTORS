# kaur_harnoor_CSS-CASCADE-SELECTION-PSEUDO-SELECTORS

I used the in-class ToDo list as starting point. Used generic selectors to add some style / visual updates to the page. 
And add functionality with CSS, selectors and the ::before and ::after pseudo selectors.

# INTRODUCTION
In this repo, there are three main lists:
1. To do
2. In progress
3. Done

All these three lists keep a record of Interactive Media Design Tasks.

# INSTALLATION
There are checkboxes in front of each component of In progress and Done lists.
Click on checkboxes to see work done. An icon of thumbs up will appear on the top right corner of the page 
while clicking on the each checkbox.

# VISUALS
A background image is added according to the list items.Appropriate colors are used.
Header background color is also used to give page a fine look.
